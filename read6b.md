4# What make a computer a computer 
its just **4** steps :
if the device do 
1. Take input  
2. Storge Store info 
3. Processing 
4. give output 

then this is an computer

## so what is input ?
its any thing give info to computer like
1. keyboard
2. mouse 
3. camera .etc 

# so what happened in computer!
its just alot of (0,1)s that wire make it and we dont understand it 
so process convert it to something we ask to do
(0,1) its a signal in wire mean (yes,no) or (True,false) 

so if out stant here u may know that circuts its something take signal and give it 
this signal its mean 1 or 0 

**so its alot and alot of simple calcultion**

## so the process go like that
Input -> Storge -> Process ->Output

## so what software ? software its a programe tell cpu what to do depens of us input
so here you will see that OS (Operating System) is an software but a spacial one 
that take what other software say to cpu and orgainze it and send it to the cpu by his way
