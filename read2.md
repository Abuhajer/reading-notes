#Code Editors

## The diffrent between the code editors its the features that the editor have , so its very important to developers ,why!?

because the code editor with good feature can save a lot of time to developer and make him more comfortable .

## what feature that make code editors diffreance ? 
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. series of themes

//---------------------

# Command Line
Text based interface to the system typing using the keyboard and feedback to us as the text

its a bit daunting , but need some time.

there a diffreance way to open terminal depens on os 

If you're on a **Mac** then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on **Linux** then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on **Windows** and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

Finialy Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier

## Basic Navigation

starting with **pwd** command which stands for Print Working Directory

### so what if we want to know current location ? 
we use **ls** short of list

In the previous commands we started touching on something called a path.
So there are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative. Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths. Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can, in fact, use either type of path (either way, the system will still be directed to the same location).

### What we want to move around system dirctory?
to move around in the system we use a command called **cd** which stands for change directory.

# Here thy summary of all above

Summary
**pwd**
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
**ls**
List the contents of a directory.
**cd**
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

**Relative path**
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
**Absolute path**
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

## Oke what about more about files .. lets go
 the first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, **everything is actually a file**
 your keyboard is a file , your monitor is a file ,for the system.

so to know about system, Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is. So for instance I could have a file myself.png which is a picture of me. I could rename the file to myself.txt or just myself and Linux would still happily treat the file as an image file.

so lets say about linux its 
1. Linux is Case Sensitive
2. Linux is an Extensionless System

So lets make a summary about it 


**file**
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

**ls -a**
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

//------------------
**Everything is a file** under Linux
Even directories.

Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.

Linux is **case sensitive**
Beware of silly typos.
